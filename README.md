Measurement-Induced State Transitions in a Superconducting Qubit: Beyond the Rotating Wave Approximation

## Abstract
Common implementations of superconducting qubits for quantum computing consist of transmon qubits and readout cavities which are used to measure the state of the qubits. Transmon qubits are made with an anharmonic energy spectrum such that the energy gap between the ground state and first excited state is different than the energy gap between the first and second excited state. Additionally, to reduce qubit decay into the environment, the qubit and cavity frequencies are significantly detuned from each other. These properties allow us to use a transmon as a two level system, ignoring any higher order terms, and analytically solve the Hamiltonian in the Jaynes-Cummings model. However, for certain photon numbers in the cavity, there can be resonances between different states that allow the qubit to be driven into higher energy states that are typically ignored in the Jaynes Cummings Hamiltonian and by the rotating wave approximation. In this project, we experimentally investigate the possibility of driving the qubit to higher energy states by populating the cavity with a large number of photons as well as derive theoretical models to explain potential resonances.
